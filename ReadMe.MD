Our term project is “Wall Escape” which is a maze that needs players to find the way to the exit. What we expect to achieve is a simple application that can interact with people by doing some operations on the screen. Players can move their position in the maze by sliding their fingers on the screen or clicking the virtual direction arrows, that depends. What’s more, there will be a map guiding the way out. In this manner, the game can be easy to play while also be interesting.

We choose OpenGL ES to construct this 3D scene, meanwhile set the texture (bricks) and lighting effect to the walls, making the display look more vivid. This simple but lively application can implement the basic computer graphics and combine it with Samsung Tizen OS. Later, maybe we can explore more on this basis, making it better.
